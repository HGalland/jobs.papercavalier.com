title: Ruby on Rails contract - Tagging system implementation 
published: false
---
We are seeking a developer or company to work on a Ruby on Rails app that provides an administration-style interface to sales generated on Amazon by Nearfine [1], an online book dealer. You will deliver a number of features to improve the application's workflow, the first of which will be implementing Gmail labels-style tagging.

In addition to requirements typical to Rails projects, familiarity with Active Admin will help.

You will work remotely with a small business team in London and New York. Good English skills are necessary.

The contract initially is short-term and per-feature. We do look to establish an ongoing relationship.
